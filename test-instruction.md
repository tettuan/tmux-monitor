# Test Instruction File

This is a test instruction file for verifying the instruction file path sending functionality.

## Commands

```bash
echo "Testing instruction file functionality"
date
echo "File path should be sent to main pane, not file content"
```

## Expected Behavior

The system should send the file path as a message to the main pane instead of reading and sending the file content.
